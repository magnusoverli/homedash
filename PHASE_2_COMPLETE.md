## 🎓 What You Learned

### Gestures Implemented
1. **Horizontal Swipe** - Carousel navigation with snap
2. **Vertical Drag** - Resize handle with constraints
3. **Swipe to Delete** - Left swipe reveals delete action
4. **Long Press** - Shows contextual menu after 500ms
5. **Tap** - Primary action (edit, select)

### Mobile UI Patterns
1. **Bottom Sheet** - Modal from bottom (planned for Phase 3)
2. **FAB (Floating Action Button)** - Quick access to "Today"
3. **Snap Scrolling** - Carousel and timeline
4. **Pull Handle** - Visual affordance for dragging
5. **Haptic Feedback** - Physical response to actions

### Performance Techniques
1. **Ref Usage** - Direct DOM manipulation for smooth gestures
2. **Event Throttling** - Scroll listeners with timeouts
3. **Conditional Rendering** - Only active carousel card updates
4. **CSS Transitions** - GPU-accelerated animations
5. **Local State** - Minimize re-renders
